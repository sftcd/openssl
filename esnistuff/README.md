# This is just an Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) placeholder

This is a stub file to point you at the branch that now
has the current Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) code.

The one deployed (a teeny bit) is the [ECH-without-ESNI](https://github.com/sftcd/openssl/tree/ECH-without-ESNI/esnistuff)
branch. The bleeding edge is in the [ECH_UPFRONT_DEC](https://github.com/sftcd/openssl/tree/ECH_UPFRONT_DEC/esnistuff)
branch.
