# This is just an Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) placeholder

This is a stub file to point you at other branches with Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) code.

- The one deployed (a teeny bit on [defo.ie](https://defo.ie)) is the [ECH-without-ESNI](https://github.com/sftcd/openssl/tree/ECH-without-ESNI/esnistuff) branch.
- The most recent "working" version (for draft-10) is the [ECH_UPFRONT_DEC](https://github.com/sftcd/openssl/tree/ECH_UPFRONT_DEC/esnistuff) branch.
- Current development is in the [ECH-draft-13](https://github.com/sftcd/openssl/tree/ECH-draft-13) branch but that's in-flux.
