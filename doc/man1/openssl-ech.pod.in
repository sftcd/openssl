=head1 NOTES

Ciphersuites are specified using a comma-separated list of IANA-registered 
codes/numbers e.g. "-c 0x20,1,3" or a comma-separated list of strings from:
- KEMs: p256, p384, p521, x25519, x448
- KDFs: hkdf-sha256, hkdf-sha384, hkdf-sha512
- AEADs: aes128gcm, aes256gcm, chachapoly1305

For example the default is: x25518, hkdf-sha256, aes128gcm

=head1 BUGS

Because this program has a lot of options and also because some of the
techniques used are rather old, the C source for this command is rather
hard to read and not a model of how things should be done.
A typical SSL client program would be much simpler.
